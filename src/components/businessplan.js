                    thinking is endorsed in principle and supported by CSIRO and
                    some renowned academic and research professionals worldwide.
                    The product presents strong encouragement to further develop
                    the product and roll out in support of the healthcare sector
                    via a strategic roadmap. The further analytics development
                    face will lead to predicting causes and situations that lead
                    to asthma and its management

                    As many as 300 million people suffer from asthma in the
                    World and will reach 400 million soon. In Australia, the
                    overall financial cost of asthma is estimated to be $30
                    billion and also the cost to patients due to the reduced
                    quality of life is around $ 21.5 billion. According to World
                    Bank estimates, it costs the World’s economies $5 trillion
